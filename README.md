# Pizza App
## Full Stack Developer Candidate - Emilio ("Leo") Segovia

### Instruction to run locally
1. Ensure you have python3 (developed with python 3.12.8) and Node.js (developed with node v23.6.0) on the system where you want to run the app locally.
2. In one terminal tab, run **./run_backend.sh**
3. In another terminal run **./run_frontend.sh**
4. Open the backend fastAPI interface by opening **http://localhost:8000/docs** in a web browser
5. Open the frontend interface by opening **http://localhost:3000** in a web browser

Note that any issues with unpacking the python venv virtual environment in run_backend.sh may be impacted by your python version.
Likewise, any issues with running **npm install** (within run_frontend.sh) may be affected by your Node version.
